         Elements can reside within other elements which create a "Tree like structure".  Programers often refer to this stucture as the Document Object Model (DOM).  This tree structure is a way to represent the hierarchical set up of the structure.

       <p> 
       	Avoiding repetition is one of the most important concepts in computer programing and its essential in all areas of programing.  Avoiding repetition can help you write good code, and helps programers make less mistakes.

       	CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  Specificity determins which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules could apply.  A selector defines what elements of the page a style will apply to.  Styles are written in the form of attribute: value. There is a way to indicated style in the HTML, however it is not recommended as it leads to repetition and can be time consuming.

         What is programing?
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        Computers rely on programs to be able to function.  Computers can be programmed to do anything as long as we are able to write programs that provide specifics steps in how to accomplish the tasks.  Programing languages provide instructions to the computer and tells it what to do.
        A computer program is a precise sequence of steps that a computer follows to perform a task.  There are a number of computer programs that exist today.  
        </p>
        Python is a programing language, and interpreter that runs programs, interprets them and executes, it lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.  Python has specific grammar rules similar to any language, however with python you have to be far more specific, which means that code has to be written perfectly otherwise it will not work.  A Python expression is something that has value and is a python statement.

         Variables and Strings
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        Variables are ways to assign a name to a value, this helps improve code readability.  Variables gives us a way to store the value of important data and also give us the ability to change its value. </p>
        <p>
        As an example: days_in_a_year = 365.  Here we are creating a variable with the value of 365, this allows us to use the name days_in_a_year, rather than using the number 365 which can be hard to understand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strings:  Computers can operate on any type of data.  Strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes (single or double).  Operators can also be used on stings and that means concatenation.  Python does not allow concatenation of strings and intergers (except multiplication) </p>
       </div>

     <div class="content" id="lesson-4-3">

         Input - Function - Output
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output. For example, a function named square might take a number as input and produce the square of that number as output. </p>
        <p>
        Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword def and then giving a function name followed by the function parameters in parentheses. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).
        In the "body" of the function, we write the code that specifies what to do with the input parameters. For example the following code could be the definition of a function called square: </p>
        <p>
        def square(x):
        answer = x * x
        return answer
        </p>
        <p>
        To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this: </p>
        <p>
        print square(4)
        >>>16
        </p>
        Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again.

         Decisions and Repetition - If and While
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        Making Decisions: Code can be made to behave differently based on decisions, this is also a way to make comparisons.  Python provides different operators for making this happen.  The output of comparisons are boolean values which are True or False.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IF statement allows the programer to test for conditions and change the behavior of the program accordigly.
        </p>
        <p>
        The While loop is similar to the IF statement however the while loop will continue to execute as long as the boolean expression is True.  There may be cases when the while-loop can go on forever unless the break statement is used.

         Debugging

       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        Bugs happen! - Errors in code are reffered to as bugs.  It is not easy to get a program right the first time and one should be prepared to spend lots of time reviewing and debuggin code.  Bugs do not nessesarily translate to a failure, but rather an inevitable part of writting code.  It is important to develop a strategy to eliminate bugs rather than beat yourself up for creating a bug in the first place.  Sometimes it is difficult to figure out that there is a bug, since not all bugs create an error msg.

         List and For Loops
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        A List is a data type where the element can be anything we want.  They could be characters, strings, numbers or other lists.  Instead using quotes as we do in strings, we use square brackets and the elements are separated by commas.  Like strings, lists can be assigned to variables.
        Lists also support Mutation, which means that we can change the value of the list after we have created it
       </p>
       <p>
        Aliasing: if there are 2 variable names that refer to the same object, any change made to the one name, affects the value of the other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other List Operations <br>
        Append: its like a procedure but its a method used similarly to the way we use find on strings, it mutates the list that it is invoked on <br>
        Plus: Behaves very similar to the concatenation operation for strings.  Plus produces a new list, it does not mutate either of the input lists. <br>
        Len: its short for lenght and it outputs the number of elements in the input.<br>
        Loops on list provides the ability to go through a list and do something with every element on the list.  For each element in the list we are going to assign that element ot the name and execute the block

         What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
              <p> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that is based on "objects" instead of only functions and procedures.  Programmers can create relationships between one object and another, for example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.  Object oriented programming techniques are used by software engineers on a daily basis, they use this method to write and share code amongst each other.  OOP's main advantage is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added, which eliminates repetition, that makes it a really valuable tool when thinking about large programming projects. There are other benefits to OOP, which include: faster code development, higher quality code and fewer opportunities for errors. </p>
             This video can help explan OOP:

        Abstraction
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
      
        Abstraction can be defined as "hiding details" and it is very powerful in programing because it allows the programmer to focus on the program that they are writing and empowers the programmer to use functions simply by reading their documentation. In Python, using the existing functions from Python Standard library is an example of abstraction. In OOP, abstraction is major principle. Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

         Object - Class - Instance - Method - Module - Library
       </div>
       <div class="content-text">
       <p> 
        Object: An object can be a variable, a data structure, or a function. In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, "object" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. </p>
        <p>
        Class:  A class is a blueprint or template or set of instructions to build a specific type of object. Every object is built from a class. </p>
        <p>
        Instance: An instance is a specific object built from a specific class. It is assigned to a reference variable that is used to access all of the instance's properties and methods. When you make a new instance the process is called instantiation 
        </p>
        <p>
        Method: A method is a procedure associated with an object class.  </p>
        <p>
        Module: A module is a file containing code that is saved for reuse in other programs or multiple places in a single programd. Modules can be used in other modules and programs by importing that module and applying it in the code.
        </p>
        Python Standard Library - according to the Python website, the Python Standard Library can be described as containing built-in modules that provide access to system functionality that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

      Class variables: This is a variable that is defined in class, but only one single copy exists. Reguardless of how many instances you create, they will all use this variable. </p>
      Method overriding: is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.  This is similar to the cascading part of CSS, where child classes inherit properties from the parent class, but the more specific rules for the child take precedence.
